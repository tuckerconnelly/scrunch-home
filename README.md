aight dog, all u gotta do is

1. copy node_modules folder over
2. copy the js folder over
3. copy the main.css file over
4. in index.html copy all the <script> tags over to ur index.html
5. copy the <style> tag over to ur index.html
6. snort some methamphetamine cause this is where shit gets boring
7. open up /js/config.js
8. edit PARTICLE_FORMED_POSITIONS to add the individual particles, like the position they form to
9. these are *relative* units, but i think they map roughly to pixels
10. 0, 0 is smack dab in the middle. negative units move left/up, positive right/down

good luck dawg

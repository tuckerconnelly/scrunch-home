aight dog, all u gotta do is

1. copy node_modules folder over
2. copy the js folder over
3. copy the main.css file over
4. in index.html copy all the <script> tags over to ur index.html
5. copy the <style> tag over to ur index.html
6. copy the <main> tag over to your index.html
7. snort some methamphetamine cause this is where shit gets boring
8. open up /js/config.js
9. edit PARTICLE_FORMED_POSITIONS to add the individual particles, like the position they form to
10. these are *relative* units, but i think they map roughly to pixels
11. 0, 0 is smack dab in the middle. negative units move left/up, positive right/down

good luck dawg

OH also, it works on everything, including iphone, but weirdly enough doesn't work on ipad. Not sure if this is a problem with BrowserStack or what, but give it a test and if it doesn't work I'll add some iPad-specific code
